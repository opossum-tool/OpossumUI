# OpossumUI: A compliance audit/review frontend.

OpossumUI is a tool to

- discover open source software used in applications.
- review licenses.
- generate reports from an open source code scan.

## Features

- use of multiple scanners (open source and/or proprietary).
- currently integrates with OSS Review Toolkit and ScanCode.
- unified interface for browsing scanner evidence.
- simple navigation through the codebase’s file tree.
- create attributions for individual files or groups.

## Use Cases

- A team performing audits for open source license compliance.
- Producing legal docs such as inventory (BOMs) and license conflicts that need to be remediated.
- OpossumUI can be used to visually inspect (QA) existing attributions, identify any false positives or incorrect
  attributions by manual selection and improve existing data.
- To aid M&A due diligence activities. OpossumUI can be used by acquirers for blind audits of intellectual property,
  since only compliance-relevant metadata is exposed in the app without the need to ever share the source code.

## Motivation

OpossumUI was developed with the goal to build a tool for managing and combining open source compliance data from
different sources. While existing analysis tools for software compliance can provide good information, using multiple of
such tools often leads to huge amounts of data due to an increased detection rate. Even though the results can be merged
and noise can be filtered through automatic tools, final manual revisions are often necessary. So, OpossumUI was born: A
light-weight app for review of compliance information for large codebases.

## Integration in the ecosystem

OpossumUI can be used with reports generated by different analysis tools and also supports exporting review results in
various different formats.

# Getting Started

## Opossum files

OpossumUI works on files with the `.opossum` file extension. These files contain license compliance data of a project
which can be visualized and edited through OpossumUI.

For details of the file format, see [file formats](docs/FileFormats.md).

## Importing other file formats

The following additional file types can be directly imported from inside OpossumUI:

- Legacy opossum files (`.json`/`.json.gz`)
- _ScanCode_ JSON files (`.json`)
- more to come

Result files (yaml / json) from the _OSS Review Toolkit_ can be converted into legacy opossum files via a reporter and
then imported as described above. The implementation of this reporter can be found in the [official OSS Review Toolkit repository](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/tree/main/plugins/reporters/opossum).

## How to get and run OpossumUI

Check out our short getting started video:

[![click to play video](docs/opossum_youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXMV04f-CHg)

### Get the latest release

Download the latest release for your OS from [GitHub](https://github.com/opossum-tool/OpossumUI/releases/latest).

### Running the app

#### Linux

#### AppImage

Run the executable _OpossumUI-for-linux.AppImage_.

Note that for ubuntu versions 22.04+ you will run into a sandboxing issue with app images (see this [electron github issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/41066) for details). This can be circumvented by opening the application with the `--no-sandbox` flag:

```shell
./OpossumUI-for-linux.AppImage --no-sandbox
```

#### snap

Install the snap file locally using

```shell
snap install ./OpossumUI-for-linux.snap --dangerous
```

Open OpossumUI via the start menu of your distribution (should be in the `development` category) or by running

```shell
opossum-ui
```

from the command line

#### macOS

Run _OpossumUI_ in _OpossumUI-for-mac.zip_.

#### Windows

Run _OpossumUI-for-win.exe_ to install the OpossumUI. Then open _OpossumUI_ from the start menu.

## Working with OpossumUI

Check out our [short video](https://youtu.be/bqGX9IQYpJY?si=BjNeCi9osPWy7z1H), which presents a basic workflow.

For an in-depth explanation, please read the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

### Exporting data

In addition to the default output file, OpossumUI provides the following export options.

#### Exporting SPDX documents

An SPDX document can be exported in the json and the yaml format through the _Export_ ⟶ _SPDX (yaml)_ and _SPDX (json)_
option in the _File_ menu.

#### Exporting BOM-like CSV files

These can be exported through the _Export_ ⟶ _Compact / Detailed component list_ option in the _File_ menu. Both
component list files contain a list of all attributions that are present in the project, including package name,
version, copyright, license name and URL. In addition, the detailed component list is more comprehensive and includes
the PURL and its subcomponents, as well as the license texts.

#### Exporting follow-up document

This can be exported through the _Export_ ⟶ _Follow-Up_ option in the _File_ menu. Similar to the component list, it
contains attributions with licenses flagged for legal review through the _Follow-Up_ checkbox in the UI.

## Limitations

SPDX License Expressions are only partially supported at the moment. Currently, a license expression can only be entered
as license name of a package. The full license text of the different licenses (e.g. GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-2-Clause) that
apply should also be entered in the license text field.
