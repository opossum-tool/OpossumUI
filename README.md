# Introduction

OpossumUI is a tool to

- explore open-source software components used in applications
- review open-source licenses contained in codebases
- generate reports from an open-source code scan

## Features

- combine findings from multiple scanners (open-source and/or proprietary)
- integration with [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort), [ScanCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit) and others
- unified interface for browsing scanner evidence
- simple navigation through the codebase's file tree
- create attributions for individual files or groups

## Use cases

- Performing audits for open-source license compliance to detect license conflicts, false positives, or incorrect attributions that need to be remediated
- Producing legal docs such as bills of materials (SBOM)
- During merger and acquisition activities, performing blind audits of intellectual property where only compliance-relevant metadata is exposed in the app without the need to ever share the source code

## Ecosystem integration

OpossumUI can be used with reports generated by different analysis tools and also supports exporting review results in
various different formats.

# Getting Started

## Opossum files

OpossumUI works on files with the `.opossum` file extension. These files contain license compliance data of a project which can be visualized and edited through OpossumUI.

For details of the file format, see [file formats](docs/FileFormats.md).

## Importing other file formats

The following additional file types can be directly imported from inside OpossumUI:

- ScanCode JSON files (`.json`)
- OWASP Dependency check (`.json`)
- more to come

Result files (yaml/json) from the OSS Review Toolkit can be converted into opossum files via a reporter and then imported as described above. The implementation of this reporter can be found in the [official OSS Review Toolkit repository](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/tree/main/plugins/reporters/opossum).

## First steps

### Get the latest release

Download the latest release for your OS from [GitHub](https://github.com/opossum-tool/OpossumUI/releases/latest).

### Running the app

#### Linux

#### AppImage

Run the executable _OpossumUI-for-linux.AppImage_.

Note that for ubuntu versions 22.04+ you will run into a sandboxing issue with app images (see this [electron github issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/41066) for details). This can be circumvented by opening the application with the `--no-sandbox` flag:

```shell
./OpossumUI-for-linux.AppImage --no-sandbox
```

#### snap

Install the snap file locally using

```shell
snap install ./OpossumUI-for-linux.snap --dangerous
```

Open OpossumUI via the start menu of your distribution (should be in the `development` category) or by running

```shell
opossum-ui
```

from the command line

#### MacOS

Run _OpossumUI_ in _OpossumUI-for-mac.zip_.

#### Windows

Run _OpossumUI-for-win.exe_ to install the OpossumUI. Then open _OpossumUI_ from the start menu.

## Working with OpossumUI

Check out our [short video](https://youtu.be/bqGX9IQYpJY?si=BjNeCi9osPWy7z1H), which presents a basic workflow.

For an in-depth explanation, please read the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

### Exports

In addition to the default output file, OpossumUI provides the following export options.

#### Exporting SPDX documents

An SPDX document can be exported in the json and the yaml format through the _Export_ ⟶ _SPDX (yaml)_ and _SPDX (json)_
option in the _File_ menu.

#### Exporting BOM-like CSV files

These can be exported through the _Export_ ⟶ _Compact / Detailed component list_ option in the _File_ menu. Both
component list files contain a list of all attributions that are present in the project, including package name,
version, copyright, license name and upstream address. In addition, the detailed component list is more comprehensive and includes
the PURL and its subcomponents, as well as the license texts.

#### Exporting follow-up document

This can be exported through the _Export_ ⟶ _Follow-Up_ option in the _File_ menu. Similar to the component list, it
contains attributions with licenses flagged for legal review through the _Follow-Up_ checkbox in the UI.

## Limitations

SPDX License Expressions are only partially supported at the moment. Currently, a license expression can only be entered
as license name of a package. The full license text of the different licenses (e.g. GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-2-Clause) that
apply should also be entered in the license text field.
